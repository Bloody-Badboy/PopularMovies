## Use the project with your own The Movie Database(TMDb) API key

* Get you own TMDb API key. See the [get an API key][0].
* Find `.gradle` folder in your home directory, create a file named `gradle.properties` (if not present).

    Usually it can be found at:

        Windows: C:\Users\<Your Username>\.gradle
        Mac: /Users/<Your Username>/.gradle
        Linux: /home/<Your Username>/.gradle

        Inside it there would be a file named gradle.properties (just create it if there isn‚Äôt any).

* Open the `gradle.properties` file and paste your API key into the value of the `THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY` property, like this

    `THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY=PASTE-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE`

* Now you should be able to successfully sync the project.
